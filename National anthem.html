    <h3>Facts:</h3>
    <p>The anthem was adopted in 1978 and replaced the previous national anthem, "Nigeria, We Hail Thee". The lyrics are a combination of words and phrases taken from five of the best entries in a national contest. The words were put to music by the Nigerian Police Band under the directorship of Benedict P. Odiase (1934-2013). The Nigerian national anthem lyrics were created by five people: P. O. Aderibigbe, John A. Ilechukwu, Dr. Sota Omoigui, Eme tim Akpan and B.A. Ogunnaike.</p>
